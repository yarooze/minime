Fun project to make a real framework based on twittee container. (http://twittee.org/)


HowTo

1. use composer to get "yarooze/twittee" from the github (and whatever modules you need)

2. set up your stuff in "src/app.php" and configure in "/config/*"

3. For CLI use something like "internal/service.php" for web - "web/index.php"

4. Enjoy!
