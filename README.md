minime
======

Fun project to make a real framework based on twittee container. (http://twittee.org/)


HowTo

1. use composer to get "yarooze/minime" from the github (and whatever modules you need)

2. Copy files from the "skeleton" dir into your project root dir

3. Overwrite base classes in "/src/App/" as you wish.

4. set up your stuff in "src/app.php" and configure in "/config/*"

5. For CLI use something like "internal/service.php" for web - "web/index.php"

6. Enjoy!
